|    What is SAW about ?

|  Starblast Asteroid War is a team mode game in which players must battle for the win.
|  Our new mode adds a large new ship tree that introduces new gameplay elements as well as new game mechanics such as solar pulses and asteroid waves..
|  A Saucer can also be seen, often referred to as the 'King of Asteroids.' Defeating this boss grants a substantial advantage.
|  And guess what.. This is only the beginning!

|    This is SAW!
