##    What is SAW about ?
Starblast Asteroid War is a team mode game in which players must battle for the win.<br>
Our new mode adds a large new ship tree that introduces new gameplay elements as well as new game mechanics such as solar pulses and asteroid waves..<br>
A Saucer can also be seen, often referred to as the 'King of Asteroids.' Defeating this boss grants a substantial advantage.<br>
And guess what.. This is only the beginning!<br>
#### This is SAW!
